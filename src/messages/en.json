At that time, misinformation and limited access to services and care were major issues, particularly for seniors and unilingual Asian immigrants living in Quebec. A group of health professionals and students came together to help this community by creating coronavirus information guides, developing community resource lists and translating health measures announcements, all in Asian mother tongues such as Mandarin, Cantonese and Vietnamese. Their goals were to optimize quality and access to care and to reduce inequalities caused by language barriers to the Asian community in Quebec.",
